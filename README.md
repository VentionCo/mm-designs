# mm-designs
This repository serves as the central hub for tracking and versioning all design files used in our main application. It provides a structured approach to maintaining and updating designs, ensuring that we have robust backup and version control for production assets. Changes and updates can be easily managed, reviewed, and tracked, reducing the risk of production issues and maintaining continuity across all design iterations.

## Purpose

- Version Control: Track design changes over time to monitor updates and modifications across versions.
- Backup Solution: Safeguard production designs, enabling quick rollbacks and restoration if any issues arise.
- Collaborative Modifications: Team members are welcome to contribute updates, fixes, or improvements to designs, provided they follow the approval process.

## Contribution Process

1. Pull Requests: Anyone can submit a pull request to propose changes to designs, especially if:
    - The design is broken or misaligned with the applicationâ€™s functionality.
    - A fix is needed following an update on the master branch.
2. Contribution Guidelines:
   - Explanation: Clearly explain the reason behind each change to ensure clarity and document the intent of the modification.
   - Screenshots: Where possible, include a screenshot highlighting the modified section of the design to aid in visual verification and review.
3. Approval:
   - Ensure that either a QA team member or a simulation team member is notified and reviews the change.
